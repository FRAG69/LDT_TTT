	<p>Welcome to the About page for the Trouble in Terrorist Town Stat Tracker! The TTT Stat Tracker is currently in development.</p>
	

	<p>The Stat Tracker currently tracks the following stats for every player in the TTT server: SteamID, Nickname, Playtime, Rounds played, Number of times Innocent, Detective & Traitor, Deaths, Kills, Highest score (per map/ session), First time seen on the server.</p>

<p>There are a few other stats that are being planned to be tracked but are not currently implemented, these include: Points (custom point system to be determined based on kills, deaths, innocent vs. innocent kills etc becoming a large persistent number).</p>
<p>DR and GMR stats are coming soon!
<P>The system was created by Handy_man and Jonzky of Skynet Gaming, this version is maintained by FRAG</P>
